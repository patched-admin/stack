# CredentialSignUp

A React component that renders a sign-up form for user registration using email and password credentials.

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignUp } from '@stackframe/stack';

function SignUpPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign Up</h1>
      <CredentialSignUp />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `CredentialSignUp` component renders a form with the following fields:

- Email input
- Password input
- Repeat password input
- Sign Up button

It handles form validation, error display, and submission to create a new user account. The component uses the `useStackApp` hook to access the application instance for sign-up functionality.
