# CredentialSignUp

A component that renders a sign-up form with email and password fields.

## Props

- `noPasswordRepeat` (optional): `boolean` - If true, the form will not include a password repeat field.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignUp } from '@stackframe/stack';

// Basic usage
<CredentialSignUp />

// Without password repeat field
<CredentialSignUp noPasswordRepeat={true} />
```

The form includes email and password fields, with optional password repeat. It handles form validation and submission, including password strength checks and email format validation.
