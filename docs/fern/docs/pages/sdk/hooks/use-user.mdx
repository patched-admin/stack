# useUser

A React hook that provides user information and loading state.

## Example

```tsx
import { useUser } from '@stackframe/stack';

function UserProfile() {
  const { user, loading } = useUser();

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return <div>Welcome, {user.name}!</div>;
}
```

## Description

The `useUser` hook is a standalone React hook that serves as an alias for `useStackApp().useUser()`. It is provided for convenience and does not have any additional functionality beyond what `stackClientApp.useUser()` offers.

For more detailed information about the underlying functionality, please refer to the [documentation for `stackClientApp.useUser()`](../objects/stack-app.mdx#stackclientappuseuseroptions).
